I recently received my Ph.D. in philosophy from Saint Louis University. Prior to coming to Saint Louis, I received my Master's degree in philosophy at the University of Saskatchewan and my Bachelor's degree in the same at the State University of New York at Buffalo. In the fall, I will be joining the University of Mary as an Assistant Professor of Philosophy. 

The main areas of my research are contemporary and medieval metaphysics, and I also have some significant interest in the philosophy of religion, ancient philosophy, early modern philosophy, and ethics. 

I wrote my dissertation on hylomorphism, and, in particular, on medieval and contemporary Neo-Aristotelian conceptions of substantial form. Therein I offer a critique of various "structural" conceptions of substantial form in favor of a more "dynamic" view, which I argue can be found in the work of Thomas Aquinas.

My Curriculum Vitae can be found here, and my contact information can be found under the "Contact" tab above.

<h2>Research</h2>
My main areas of interest are contemporary and medieval metaphysics. On the contemporary side, I am interested in issues pertaining to substance, material composition, identity over time, and the ontology of human persons. On the medieval side, I am interested in articulating and defending the views of Thomas Aquinas on these and related issues. Much of my work, then, involves translating Aquinas's claims into contemporary terms and situating his views within contemporary debates. In my MA thesis, for example, I argued that Aquinas's hylomorphic account of personal identity offers an intriguing alternative to the main theories currently on offer. And in my dissertation, I explored Aquinas's views on substance and substantial form, arguing that a Thomistic account of substantial form has some significant advantages over other contemporary Neo-Aristotelian accounts. 

For more information on my published or forthcoming articles and current research projects, please see the descriptions below. There you will find titles and abstracts for several of my works in progress.

Published or Forthcoming Articles

"Three Concerns for Structural Hylomorphism", Analytic Philosophy (forthcoming)

Abstract. Many contemporary proponents of hylomorphism, the view that at least some material objects are comprised of both matter and form, endorse a version of hylomorphism according to which the form of a material object is a certain complex relation or structure. In this paper, I introduce three sorts of concerns for this “structural" approach. First, I argue that, in countenancing an abundance of overlapping yet numerically distinct material objects, "structural hylomorphists" are committed to a certain sort of systematic causal overdetermination. Second, I argue that, because of its relatively thin conception of form, the view risks collapsing into some already well-entrenched metaphysical account of material objects. Finally, I argue that because the view emphasizes the more static structural features of composite material objects, structural hylomorphists seem unable to explain how it is that those objects might be said to persist over time through changes in such features.

"Complex Survivalism, or: How to Lose Your Essence and Live to Tell About It", Proceedings of the American Catholic Philosophical Association (forthcoming)

Abstract. Among those who defend a Thomistic, hylomorphic account of human persons, "survivalists" hold that the persistence of the human person's rational soul between death and the resurrection is sufficient to maintain the persistence of the human person herself throughout that interim. ("Corruptionists" deny this.) According to survivalists, at death, and until the resurrection, a human person comes to be temporarily composed of, but not identical to, her rational soul. One of the major objections to survivalism is that it is committed to a rejection of a widely-accepted mereological principle called the weak-supplementation principle, according to which any composite whole must, at every moment of its existence, possess more than one proper part. In this paper, I argue that by recognizing the existence of certain other metaphysical parts of a human person beyond her prime matter and her rational soul, hylomorphists can adhere to survivalism without violating the weak-supplementation principle. In order to make this solution work, however, survivalists may have to accept the claim that a human person can outlive her own essence.

"Hylomorphism and the Priority Principle", Metaphysica (forthcoming)

Abstract. According to Jeffrey Brower’s hylomorphic account of material substances, prime matter and substantial forms together compose material substances, and material substances and accidental forms together compose accidental unities. In a recent article, Andrew Bailey has argued that Brower's account has the counter-intuitive implication that no human person is ever the primary possessor, the primary thinker, of her own thoughts. In this paper, I consider various ways in which Brower might reply to this objection. I first consider several “invariant strategies”, solutions that do not require any significant alteration to Brower’s account. I argue that these strategies are unsuccessful. I then introduce two ways of modifying Brower's hylomorphic account of material substances so as to avoid Bailey’s objection. I argue that these “variant strategies” are successful, but they require that Brower significantly alter one or more of the main features of his account.

"A Better Solution to the General Problem of Creation", European Journal for Philosophy of Religion, Vol. 9, No. 1 (Spring 2017): pp. 147-162. 

Abstract. Could God have chosen not to create? Or was it necessary that He create at least some universe or other (even if it was not necessary that He create any universe in particular)? It is often suggested that, since the state of affairs in which God creates a good universe is, in some relevant sense, better than the state of affairs in which He creates nothing at all, a perfectly good God would have to create at least that good universe. Making use of recent work by Christine Korsgaard on the relational nature of the good, I argue that the state of affairs in which God creates a good universe might not actually be better than the state of affairs in which God creates nothing at all, due to the fact that it is not better for anyone or anything in particular. If this turns out to be right, then even a perfectly good God would not be compelled to create a good universe. In such case, God could indeed have chosen not to create.

"How Simple is Your Soul? Thomas Aquinas's Psychic Mereology"

Abstract. According to Thomas Aquinas, a human person’s rational soul is both the substantial form of the body and an immaterial substance capable of existing and acting on its own after the body’s destruction. In Aquinas's ontology, substantial forms are simple, completely lacking in any parts. And so, as a substantial form, the soul should be mereologically simple. On the other hand, in Aquinas's ontology, immaterial substances, i.e., angels, are not completely simple; they are composites of essence and existence, as well as various “potential” and “accidental” parts related to their acts of intellect and will. And so, as an immaterial substance, the soul should be mereologically complex. Is, then, the soul, like other substantial forms, simple, completely lacking in parts, or is it, like other immaterial substances, mereologically complex, comprised of certain immaterial parts? In this paper, I investigate the interpretive options for resolving this particular tension in Aquinas’s account of the soul. And I conclude, tentatively, that the most promising strategy for resolving this tension is to interpret Aquinas as holding that the rational soul is indeed mereologically simple, completely lacking in any parts.

"Accidental Forms as Metaphysical Parts of Material Substances in Aquinas's Ontology"

Abstract. Like Aristotle, Thomas Aquinas holds that all material substances are composed of form and matter. But, following Aristotle, Aquinas also distinguish between two sorts of forms that material substances can possess: substantial forms and accidental forms. Of which form (or forms), then, are material substances composed, on his view? According to what I will refer to as the "Standard Model", Aquinas’s view is that a material substance is composed of only prime matter and substantial form. On the Standard Model, the accidental forms of a material substance, its non-essential attributes, do not enter into its composition; they are in no way parts of it. According to what I will refer to as the "Expanded Model", Aquinas’s view is that a material substance is composed of prime matter, its substantial form, and all of its accidental forms. On the Expanded Model, the accidental forms of a material substance do enter into its composition; each of its accidents is included among its metaphysical parts. In this paper, I argue that the Expanded Model more accurately reflects Aquinas’s view of material substances. Based on the way in which he argues for God’s simplicity in question three of the Prima pars, and the way in which he consistently describes the difference between an essence and a suppositum, or individual substance, throughout his works, I argue that there is good reason to believe that Aquinas thought that the accidental forms of a material substance are included among its metaphysical parts. I close by considering some potentially significant implications of this conclusion.

"Existential Import and the Contingent Necessity of Descartes' Eternal Truths"

Abstract. Throughout his philosophical works, though more often in his correspondence than in his published manuscripts, Descartes sets aside certain logical and mathematical propositions as comprising a distinct and important category known as the "eternal truths". According to Descartes, these eternal truths are both necessary and contingently willed by God. As Descartes explains in several places, propositions such as "twice four makes eight" or "the whole is greater than its parts" are such that God could have freely made any or all of them false. But if God could have made any or all of these eternal truths false, how could they be necessary? In this paper, I provide a new reading of Descartes' doctrine of the eternal truths according to which these two claims are in fact consistent. My reading is comprised of two main theses. First, I argue that Descartes' doctrine of the eternal truths in no way commits him to the claim that God could have willed an impossible state of affairs. On my reading, Descartes' doctrine only commits him to the claim that God could have freely refrained from creating the eternal essences in which the eternal truths are grounded. Second, I argue that, for Descartes, the eternal truths are not absolutely necessary but conditionally necessary. Given that God freely chooses to create anything at all, He necessarily creates all and only the eternal truths that He does in fact create.

<h2>Teaching</h2>
I like to organize each of the courses that I teach around a central thesis. For example, the central thesis of my introduction to philosophy is that we should continue to recognize ancient and medieval philosophers as rich resources of valuable insights concerning the ultimate questions of human life. And the central thesis of my course on the philosophy of the human person is that a number of important views in applied ethics and the philosophy of religion depend for their plausibility on the plausibility of a particular ontology of the human person.

Through their assignments, I also like to demonstrate to my students that the tools and concepts that they have acquired from their (albeit brief) study of philosophy can be usefully applied outside of the classroom. For example, I often ask my introductory students to use their newly-gained critical thinking skills to identify informal fallacies present in newspaper articles or televised debates. And, toward the end of my ethics course, I have each of the students engage one of his or her peers in a "silent debate" on some particular applied issue, requiring that he or she make use of one or more of the ethical theories covered in class to reach his or her conclusions. 

In general, my goals as a philosophy instructor are to inspire in my students an appreciation for the perennial questions of philosophy, and to teach them how to think carefully and critically about important issues.
